The tracking data structures were built after a brief discussion with Prof. Aaron Bobick
and also with reference to the paper "Real Time Closed-World Tracking" by Stephen.S.Intille, James.W.Davis and Aaron.F.Bobick, 1997 IEEE.

This might be a good starting point for implementing a tracking algorithm.
